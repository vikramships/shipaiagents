it's been around 5 to 7 days, since we launched this directory. got 1k visitors


Here's what I have been thinking: 

currently, we have prompts for generating ai agents in claude code. But any I can give this prompts. How do we differ from them. 
Really want to build something useful it really should be useful to users not some directory with some Random prompts that are easy to generate using any AI.

so I think we should Think something useful that real people like and keep engaging on this site Think of ideas you can give me so we can transform this into a engaging and useful site thanks
